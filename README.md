### About me

I am a professional software developer, journeyman in everything agile, and believe in the minimalism of all things. Since recently, I am also an ergonomics enthusiast.

I am currently working as engineering team lead for an IT security company. Technically, I am most proficient in C, C++ and Python, though I like to dabble with technologies, just to get a feel for them (Rust, Perl, Lisp, and frontend frameworks/libraries such as Vue.js or d3.js).

Ask me about Fantasy books (actually, don't, unless you have too much time)

Fun fact: The fear of the number 13 is called "triskaidekaphobia". The fear of bugs is called "software development".
